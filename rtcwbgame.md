# Wolfenstein: Return To Castle – Chapter 1
## Board Game Documentation

---

## 1. Game Analysis

Experience the nostalgic feel of a classic with improved, realistic graphics compared to its predecessors. The game delivers a variable emotional experience—from intense stress to creepy, eerie atmospheres that can escalate to genuine scares depending on the level. Gameplay alternates between fast-paced action and slow, methodical advancement with mixed or forced play styles. This adaptation recreates both Stealth and Run 'n Gun approaches.

## 2. Design Concept

The tabletop version simulates Chapter 1 using a DnD-style grid map representing sections of the castle and village. Each tile represents a space where players can move or engage enemies.

### Playable Chapters/Maps
- **Castle Section 1** – Escape
- **Castle Section 2** – Escape 2
- **Tram/Elevator** – Tram

> **Note:**

- Orange Circles = Enemies that can be passed with stealth

Draw a poker card at the start of each turn in designated event zones:

- **Diamonds** = Healing item
- **Clubs** = Ammo used (set aside)

**Card Values**: Use cards Ace (1) through 10 only. King, Queen, Jack, and Joker are not used.
